# Fly-the-Copter

## Game Mechanics:
The game mechanics are very simple. First, there is a start menu with 2 buttons: one allows you to go to the game screen and play a game, and the other is a help button that explains the game's controls.

The game controls are based on tapping anywhere on the screen to make the helicopter ascend. When you stop tapping, it will automatically descend until you tap again.

The objective of the game is to advance across the screen, dodging the obstacles that appear and avoiding the ceiling and the floor by tapping the screen to ascend and releasing to descend.

When you press the play button in the menu, you are taken to the game screen, which has a pause button in case you need to stop the game. When you press continue, it will return to its previous state, exactly where you left off.

If you lose, you will be taken to the game over screen, which gives you the option to return to the main menu to play another game.


IMPORTANT: Because Android Studio does not typically work with C++, to open the project from Android Studio, you must open the folder with the path:
Fly-the-Copter/proyect/android-studio-3.5

**A functional, compiled APK version is already available.**
